# dotvectors
3D dotvectors in C

Original written with Watcom C in 90's this was some very basic demo code once. I re-used part aftwards when studying at Metropolia University of Applied Sciences during learning the basics of C -programming course. 

Rotates simple object (text 'metropolia') defined as dots around center of it's axis. 

Dependency to build: OpenGL utility toolkit (Glut) library in path (used for double-buffering and drawing canvas, rest is done old-fashioned). Makefile and compilation tested on OS X.
